The popular Primitive Technology blog features an unnamed man in Far North Queensland in Australia building tools and structures using only raw, found materials. In this instalment, the man builds a kiln from termite mound clay before crafting and eventually firing a pot, an urn, a forge-blower and several roof tiles. The resulting video falls somewhere between a rugged wilderness survival guide and a soothing DIY arts-and-crafts tutorial. To learn more about the step-by-step process while watching, turn on closed captions in the YouTube video player.|||
