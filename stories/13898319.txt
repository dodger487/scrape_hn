Weight loss is pretty simple when you get down to it: Calories In - Calories Out = Weight Change. “Calories out” are a combination of TDEE (at-rest daily caloric expenditure), exercise and metabolism, while “calories in” are solely impacted by what you eat.

As a 5'6" 275lbs male, I would need to consume 3,000+ calories daily to maintain my current weight. According to my calculations, If I reduced my daily caloric intake to 1,200 calories/day I would experience a 3lbs a week weight lose. Well, that’s what I did and that’s the rough average I got.
