Boomerang, a streaming service that offers a catalog of more than 5,000 cartoons, is officially live. Subscribers can pay $5 a month to stream classic and current cartoons, including your childhood favorites like Looney Tunes, Scooby-Doo, Bugs Bunny, Tom and Jerry, and more.

Boomerang was originally offered as a cable channel on Time Warner Cable (among other providers,) but has now been spun off as a standalone streaming service dedicated to cartoons. Customers can also subscribe on an annual basis for $39.99, which drops the cost down to $3.33 a month. According to its official website, Boomerang offers new episodes every week (though it doesn’t specify which shows will receive new weekly content) and offers more than 1,000 episodes of the classic cartoons named above. It does not appear that the previously advertised shows, like The Jetsons and The Flintstones are available at launch though it is expected to be added soon. You can have a look through the current catalog here.

Boomerang is available to US customers on desktop, Android, and iOS — support for streaming devices like the Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, Roku, and Chromecast are upcoming. While Boomerang does compete with services like HBO for Sesame Street and Nickelodeon’s Noggin, it is by far the least expensive of the bunch. Which service you choose will likely depend on how much you want to rewatch the classics with your kids, nieces, and nephews.|||
