The summer exam season is underway for thousands of university students across Britain. But at this time of increased pressure, some are turning to smart drugs to help them cope.

These substances, the most popular ones being Ritalin, Adderall and Modafinil, are used to to improve concentration, memory and mental stamina for the purpose of studying.

Last month a leading academic warned Dundee students about the dangers of these drugs during exam time. Professor Tim Hales, head of neuroscience at Dundee University, says students could be risking their long-term health by taking them.

It comes after warnings about a national trend towards an increase in smart drugs across UK universities. According to a survey conducted by Oxford University student newspaper Cherwell, out of a total of 662 responses, 15.6% of students have knowingly taken Modafinil or another study drug without prescription. The university has now introduced smart drug workshops to educate young people. 



The use of these drugs without a prescription is illegal and experts warn that it could result in unwanted side effects.

What are your experiences? We want to hear from professors and students about how widespread use is. Have you heard of others taking Ritalin or Modafinil? Does it get advertised often on campus? Does interest in these drugs ramp up during exam time? Perhaps you’re a university professor, have you noticed a rise in use? Does it worry you? Share stories.|||
