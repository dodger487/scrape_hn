Snapchat's user growth slowed to its lowest pace in years, as parent company Snap Inc. missed Wall Street expectations for its first quarterly earnings as a public company on Wednesday, sending its shares plunging more than 20% in after-hours trading.

Snap added 8 million new daily users in the first three months of the year, representing year-on-year growth of 36%. At this time last year, Snapchat was growing its DAUs by 52%.

Snapchat's weak user growth comes as Facebook has intensified its mimicking of the Snapchat Stories format across its suite of apps. Instagram Stories recently outpaced Snapchat by reaching 200 million daily users.

Snap said that its hefty net loss of $2 billion during the quarter was attributed to stock-based compensation related to its February initial public offering.
