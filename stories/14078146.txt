6 months ago I analyzed the version 66.0 of the Facebook.app for iOS:

The version 66.0 was a 165 MB app on an iPad Air 2 (64-bit). It was a monolithic app with its main binary being more than 100 MB.

The version 87.0 is now available: 253 MB on the same iPad Air 2 with only 64-bit code. In just 6 months, the Facebook.app size grew by 88 MB!

Looking at the app content of the version 87.0 using GrandPerspective gives a good overview:

Here is how the content of the version 66.0 looked like:

As you can see, the Facebook.app has been completely restructured:

One of the reason the app size grew is due to multiple copies of the same resources inside the app.

You can actually see in the previous screenshot 3 copies of the same file ‘unetshallow_init.pb’:

Keeping only one copy would save 7.2 MB.

Similarly the DataFiles folder appears 3 times. Keeping a single copy would save around 2 MB:

Some resources called ‘FBFacecastTipJarResources’ appear to be duplicated no less than 6 times in the app! The ‘FBFacecastTipJarResources’ resources only take 150 KB on disk but 6 times makes 900 KB.

There are a bunch of other duplicated resources, amongst them:

These listed resources count for 15.5 MB. By removing the duplicated resources, you could save at least 10 MB.

All the 1972 images in FBSharedFramework are inside the main Assets.car and also part of the FBNotOnStartupPathFramework Assets.car. So there are 3 times the same 1972 images taking 3 * 9.5 MB = 28.5 MB.

Keeping a single set of these 1972 images would save 19 MB.

The remaining images in the main Assets.car (2267 – 1972 = 295) and in the FBNotOnStartupPathFramework Assets.car (2126 – 1972 = 154) are unique.

The Facebook.app gained 5 new localizations, increasing the app size by 4.2 MB:

 hi.lproj (1.3 MB)

 hr.lproj (692 KB)

 hu.lproj (750 KB)

 ro.lproj (709 KB)

 sk.lproj (713 KB)

Also each localization got a new 12 KB file called ‘AdsCountriesConfig.json’. This adds 336 KB.

When analyzing the version 66.0 I completely missed some amusing Objective-C interfaces, protocols and methods:

Although the main binary is much smaller than the App Review limitation, the Facebook.app still uses a __RODATA segment containing sections generally found inside the __TEXT segment. For more information about it, please look at the previous post http://blog.timac.org/?p=1303.

Between version 66.0 and 87.0, the Facebook.app has been completely restructured. The main -and only- binary has been split in several frameworks.

It appears however that during this process a couple of resources have been unnecessarily duplicated:

Removing the duplicated resources would save at least 40 MB. This partially explains why the app size has increased by 90 MB.|||
