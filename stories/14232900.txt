It’s hard to have a discussion about higher education in America without quickly falling into a debate about cost, access, the achievement gap, student debt, and administrative bloat. But, what if the conversation consisted of stories of innovation, testimonies of effective career prep, and tales of faculty members who know their students by name?

What if we could forget about the 400 years of history that brought us to the current state of college and focus on the future? What if we could rebuild college from the ground up? In many ways, we’re already doing it. . . online.

So, forgetting about the past is probably not the best idea, but we can learn from our successes and failures to think about how to reengineer higher education in America. Can we take what works in a traditional, residential model and apply it to digital education agencies? Can we scrap the current tenure model and make faculty members focus on teaching rather than research? What if paying for college was based on anticipated earned income?
