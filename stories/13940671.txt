Example on a testing framework based solely on bash one-liners. It's validation testing on the website and API of Consolia, my webcomic.

What does it do? I like to know certain things about my website / API when deploying. Things i can keep checking always. Things like:

Are the html pages / json responses being compressed? Is https working? Using the right tls negotiation protocol? Is Varnish caching properly? Is it skipping the cache wherever it should? Does the homepage show the latest comic? Is that comic image returning a 200? Is the Cache-Control header set properly for all assets in the pages? Are all other pages returning 200's? Are requests to the assets folders returning 403's? Are redirect endpoints returning 303's? Are non-existent pages returning 404's?

Etcetera. This simple script does that for me, using nothing but bash one-liners.|||
