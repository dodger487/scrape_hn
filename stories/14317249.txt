Amazon’s new Echo Show has a touch screen that allows users to make video calls to others who have the device, or an iPhone or Android device with an Alexa app.

These are no longer just idle words. Alexa, the voice-triggered smart assistant from Amazon that powers the company’s Echo speakers, will soon be able to do just that.

On Tuesday, Amazon unveiled the newest addition to its Echo devices — the Echo Show — which come with a seven-inch touch screen and the ability to make voice and video calls using a Wi-Fi connection.

Yes, Amazon is adding communications capabilities to the Echo so that it acts more or less like a landline phone in your home, write Brian X. Chen and Nick Wingfield, technology reporters for The New York Times.

This is interesting for several reasons. Amazon largely missed out on the smartphone boom several years ago, but it has now found a way into the communications game with the Echo and Alexa. The addition also continues Amazon’s first-mover advantage with the Echo by giving it new capabilities ahead of rivals. All of which may help cement Echo’s place in our homes.

So perhaps the real question now is this: Alexa, just how far will Amazon take this?|||
