A lot of us chuckled when we saw Google Cardboard for the first time, but it’s actually quite genius. Google shared today that its virtual reality experience Google Cardboard is now available in 39 languages and over 100 countries for both Android and iOS.

The developer docs are now in 10 languages, to make the VR experience even more worldwide.

The 15 million installs of Cardboard apps is pretty impressive, given that we all thought it was a gimmick. Truth is, it’s the way that most people will experience virtual reality for the first time…and before they buy expensive equipment like an Oculus.

Want to travel to beautiful places but don’t have the cash? Google Street View now works with Cardboard, so just update the app for iOS or Android and pop Cardboard onto your device.|||
