The Debian Project is concerned to hear that one of our members, Dmitry Bogatov, has been arrested by Russian authorities.

Dmitry is a mathematics teacher, and an active Debian contributor. As a Debian Maintainer, he worked in the Debian Haskell group and currently maintains several packages for command line and system tools.

We await further details of the case against him, but hope that he receives fair treatment and due process.

In the meantime, the Debian Project has taken measures to secure its systems by removing Dmitry's keys in the case that they are compromised.

The Debian Project honours his good work and strong dedication to Debian and Free Software, and we hope he is back as soon as possible to his endeavours.

We send our full support to him and his family.

The Debian Project is an association of Free Software developers who volunteer their time and effort in order to produce the completely free operating system Debian GNU/Linux.
