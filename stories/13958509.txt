You are born as a fully-grown adult. God decides that some bodyparts are not appropriate. Those are dynamically replaced and patched to fit God's plan. He doesn't care if the new parts are rejected by the body: God doesn't ask for permission. Either way, since you are already an adult, you are ready to start a job. You ask the universe for a vehicle, and the universe gives you a generic object. You can't tell what it is. However, you do see what appears to be a steering wheel. You carefully put your hand on it. Suddenly, you hear a motor starting, and the object moves. After a short time, the police stops you. Apparently you are driving a racecar, without license plate. You are confused. "I can't see that this is a racecar, I only see the steering wheel. Why can they?". Maybe they're checking the type? "But that's illegal!" Deeply irritated that the authorities would break their own rules, you pay your fine and continue driving to work.

At work you tell a colleague of the incident with the police. But after you finished the first sentence, the colleague starts foaming at the mouth, and screams: "Unicode decode error!" A flash of light, and the colleague disappears. He had it coming, you think to yourself. Was probably coming from the old, sort-of-deprecated version of the universe. No way that will ever happen to you.

For lunch, you and your colleagues go to the canteen. On your tablet, there is already a free default meal. There are also some other paid choices available, but you are not aware of them. You eat your free meal. You die. You are reborn, but this time you are told to avoid the default meal. At the canteen you order a paid meal this time. Turns out the default option is poisonous. The canteen had some problems preparing your meal, but this time you at least don't die from it.

After some years you do die of natural causes. Most of your organs begin to decompose, but some organs continue to exist until your planet explodes. The words "resource warning" appear in the sky, for nobody to see them.

This was inspired by (but is not completely analogous to) "A bad citizen in Javaland".|||
