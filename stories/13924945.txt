 Adium is a popular instant messaging client for MacOS (OSX) that incorporates libpurple. The current release (1.5.10.2) is vulnerable to CVE-2017-2640 in libpurple, which permits execution of arbitrary code on the client. The Adium team has been aware of the vulnerability since at least March 15, but has not released an advisory to its users, for reasons unknown. A post to the official developer's mailing list, which included vulnerability information and queries about Adium's process for handling upstream advisories from libpurple, has gone unanswered. Adium's build process documentation does not seem to include steps for upgrading or rebuilding libpurple, and the copy of libpurple checked into Adium's open-source repository as a binary blob of unknown provenance.
