Ryan Hoover built Product Hunt by creating a 20 minute MVP which really worked. In three years, Product Hunt has millions of active users and recently got acquired by Angel List. Ryan didn't have a tech background at the time he started PH, but has been obsessed with startups and writing about them. I have collected and stitched together the most useful articles and videos to put in context what we could learn from Ryan's success.
