Polymer is a lightweight library that helps you take full advantage of Web Components.

With Web Components, you can create reusable custom elements that interoperate seamlessly with the browser’s built-in elements, or break your app up into right-sized components, making your code cleaner and less expensive to maintain.

Polymer sprinkles a bit of sugar over the standard Web Components APIs, making it easier for you to get great results.|||
