This repo is a public supplement to the (private) course Moodle. Students enrolled in the course may find slightly fuller and more up-to-date materials on the Moodle.

Numbered folders contain the materials for specific weeks — at least the Jupyter notebooks, and often also slides or lecture notes (when they exist).|||
