Build a landing page complete with pricing tables and watch how many customers are willing to sign up for one of your plans. Once they hit Sign Up, tell them your product isn't ready yet and collect their email addresses. 📩

Immediately talk to your future customers, now that they signed up for your waiting list. Find out who they are and what problems they are currently facing. What is their dream of a better life? 🏝🏖

You have enough interested customers and came up with a solution for their problems? Perfect. Time to roll up your sleeves and make the magic happen. 🎩💫🐇|||
