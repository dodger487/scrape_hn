A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

USN-3239-1 introduced a regression in the GNU C Library.

USN-3239-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the GNU C Library. Unfortunately,

the fix for CVE-2015-5180 introduced an internal ABI change within

the resolver library. This update reverts the change. We apologize

for the inconvenience.

Please note that long-running services that were restarted to compensate

for the USN-3239-1 update may need to be restarted again.

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled the

 strxfrm() function. An attacker could use this issue to cause a denial

 of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected

 Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2015-8982)

 

 It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the

 _IO_wstr_overflow() function of the GNU C Library. An attacker could

 use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary

 code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04

 LTS. (CVE-2015-8983)

 

 It was discovered that the fnmatch() function in the GNU C Library

 did not properly handle certain malformed patterns. An attacker could

 use this to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu

 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (CVE-2015-8984)

 

 Alexander Cherepanov discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the

 glob implementation of the GNU C Library. An attacker could use this

 to specially craft a directory layout and cause a denial of service.

 (CVE-2016-1234)

 

 Florian Weimer discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the DNS

 resolver of the GNU C Library. An attacker could use this to cause

 a denial of service. (CVE-2015-5180)

 

 Michael Petlan discovered an unbounded stack allocation in the

 getaddrinfo() function of the GNU C Library. An attacker could use

 this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-3706)

 

 Aldy Hernandez discovered an unbounded stack allocation in the sunrpc

 implementation in the GNU C Library. An attacker could use this to

 cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-4429)

 

 Tim Ruehsen discovered that the getaddrinfo() implementation in the

 GNU C Library did not properly track memory allocations. An attacker

 could use this to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected

 Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. (CVE-2016-5417)

 

 Andreas Schwab discovered that the GNU C Library on ARM 32-bit

 platforms did not properly set up execution contexts. An attacker

 could use this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-6323)



The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

To update your system, please follow these instructions: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
