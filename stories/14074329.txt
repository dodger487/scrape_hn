Respectfully, what the fuck are you doing? TheShadowBrokers voted for you. TheShadowBrokers supports you. TheShadowBrokers is losing faith in you. Mr. Trump helping theshadowbrokers, helping you. Is appearing you are abandoning “your base”, “the movement”, and the peoples who getting you elected.

#1 — Goldman Sach (TheGlobalists) and Military Industrial Intelligence Complex (MIIC) cabinet

#2 — Backtracked on Obamacare

#3 — Attacked the Freedom Causcus (TheMovement)

#4 — Removed Bannon from the NSC

#5 — Increased U.S. involvement in a foreign war (Syria Strike)

The peoples whose voted for you, voted against the Republican Party, the party that tried to destroying your character in the primaries. The peoples who voted for you, voted against the Democrat Party, the party that hates, mocks, and laughs at you. Without the support of the peoples who voted for you, what do you think will be happening to your Presidency? Without the support of the people who voted for you, do you think you’ll be still making America great again? Do you be remembering when you were sitting there at the Obama Press Party and they were all laughing at you? Do you be remembering when you touring the country and all those peoples believed in you and supported you? You were those peoples hope. How do you be thinking it will be feeling when those people turn on you? Will they be laughing at you, hating you, and mocking you too?

TheShadowBrokers doesn’t want this to be happening to you, Mr. Trump. TheShadowBrokers is wanting to see you succeed. TheShadowBrokers is wanting America to be great again. TheShadowBrokers acknowledging, we don’t be having all the inside information you do, things might look different inside the bubble. TheShadowBrokers is having suggestion. Maybe you be making YouTube video is in order, to be explaining to your voters, your supporters, you didn’t fuck them all over. Because from theshadowbrokers seat is looking really bad. If you made deal(s) be telling the peoples about them, peoples is appreciating transparency. But what kind of deal can be resulting in chemical weapons used in Syria, Mr. Bannon’s removal from the NSC, US military strike on Syria, and successful vote for SCOTUS without change rules? Mr. Trump whose war are you fighting? Israeli Nationalists’ (Zionist) and Goldman Sachs’ war? Chinese Globalists’ and Goldman Sachs war? Is not looking like you fighting the domestic wars, the movement elected you to be fighting. You not being in office three months and already you looking like the MIIC’s bitch with John McCain and Chuck Schumer double dutch ruddering each other in the corner over dead corpses.

Mr Trump, we getting it. You having special empathy for father whose daughter is killed. We know this is root cause for anti-illegal immigrant policy. Illegal immigrant shoot man’s daughter in San Francisco. Now is Syrian man daughter killed by chemical gas. We agree its needless tragedy. But tragedies happening everyday and wars endangers all the children not just Syrian.

Mr President theshadowbrokers would like to be making some suggestion regarding why you were being elected, is just being friendly reminders.

- Don’t care what is written in the NYT, Washington Post, or any newspaper, so just ignore it.

- Don’t care if you swapped wives with Mr Putin, double down on it, “Putin is not just my firend he is my BFF”.

- Don’t care if the election was hacked or rigged, celebrate it “so what if I did, what are you going to do about it”.

- Don’t care if your popular or nice, get er done, Obama’s fail, thinking he could create compromise. No compromise.

- Don’t want foreign wars, Do want domestic wars, “drain the swamp”, “destroy the nanny state”

- Don’t care about your faith, you sound like a smuck when you try to say god things

- DO support the ideologies and policies of Steve Bannon, Anti-Globalism, Anti-Socialism, Nationalism, Isolationism

TheShadowBrokers is having some other suggestions.

Globalism

If Globalism is being so cool and awesome, why all the peoples come to only one country, American? Isn’t that being opposite of globalism? If globalism shouldn’t all peoples be staying in own countries and America be exporting culture and ideas to them? If cultures, beliefs, and philosophies of Africa, Asia, and India is being so cool and awesome, why isn’t everyone immigrating there? Because its not and they aren’t. European or Western Culture has proven is being best and most dominant, nothing to do with skin colors, white, brown, yellow, but is having to do with being red. No not red communism, red as in blood. European ancestors did the work, the thinking, the rebelling, the fighting, the killing, and the dying. Sometimes they being on rite side of history and sometimes not, but result is being great culture and society. “But, America is nation of immigrants!” Yes, but until 30 years ago most immigrants being Europeans. Jeudeo-Christian Europeans minor cultural differences. Don’t bring the world to America, bring America to the world. America first. English first. American workers first. American students first. American culture first.

White Privilege

Dear Americans, do you seek black privileged, reparation, and free shit? TheShadowBrokers is having program for you, is calling it the “Obama Ticket.” The U.S. government will be setting aside 1 Trillion, made up, borrowed from ourselves, debased Federal Reserve dollars to be sending any American resident, who wishes, regardless of skin color, on an all expense paid, permanent trip to Africa. Be telling your friends. Be telling your family. Be taking as many of them (friends and family) with you. Some condition be applying, accepting an Obama Ticket automatically revokes your Unites States citizenship, your are not being allow to return, for one generation, no exceptions. Call 1–800–555–1212

Socialist Collectivism

Africa not being for you. Do you liking socialism? Collectivism? Are all animals equal, but some animals more equal than others? Do you like wearing black? Then maybe the Socialist Workers Paradise of North Korea is for you. Please call the same number above and select menu option #2.

Russia

For peoples still being confused about TheShadowBrokers and Russia. If theshadowbrokers being Russian don’t you think we’d be in all those U.S. government reports on Russian hacking? TheShadowBrokers isn’t not fans of Russia or Putin but “The enemy of my enemy is my friend.” We recognize Americans’ having more in common with Russians than Chinese or Globalist or Socialist. Russia and Putin are nationalist and enemies of the Globalist, examples: NATO encroachment and Ukraine conflict. Therefore Russia and Putin are being best allies until the common enemies are defeated and America is great again.

MAGA

President Trump, theshadowbrokers is offering our services to you and your administration. Did you know most of theshadowbrokers’ members have taken the oath “…to protect and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic…”. Yes sir! Most of us used to be TheDeepState everyone is talking about. But we realized TheDeepState is being the enemy of the constitution, individualism, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. With the right funding we can recruit some of the best hacker intel peoples in United States and world. “Unmasking” is being new buzz word, so we use. TheShadowBrokers is being happy to unmask anyone we considering to be an enemy of the Constitution of the United States. Enemies like John McCain. Something doesn’t rub theshadowbrokers rite about Vietnam War POW who at every opportunity seeks to do violence to others via the proxy of young service men and women. If anyone should be being pacifist, slow to pick fight it should be being former POW. TheShadowBrokers is sure if we “unmasking”, Senator McCain, Magog itself might come out, many defense contractors, Saudi Princes, and possibly little Vietnamese boy he shares with Senator Lindsey Graham, not cool! Mr. Trump we know you are having DOJ and FBI, so why you be needing theShadowBrokers? You don’t, but theshadowbrokers is confused. Why haven’t you served search warrant to NYT, Washington Post, Goldman Sacks, Jeff Bezos, and all other Globalist for investigation and prosecution of treason, sedition, and un-American activities during a time of war? The Alien and Sedition Act? A Un-American Activites commitee? Doing so, you could be seizing all their IT systems, freeze their financial assets, arrest key leadership. Every American is innocent until proven guilty and has the right to fair trial by jury, but investigation and trials take a really really long time and is being very difficult to run a business and make money for shareholder when FBI and DOJ has all your IT systems.

Mr. President Trump theshadowbrokers sincerely is hoping you are being the real deal and that you received this as constructive criticism toward #MAGA. Some American’s consider or maybe considering TheShadowBrokers traitors. We disagreeing. We view this as keeping our oath to protect and defend against enemies foreign and domestic. TheShadowBrokers wishes we could be doing more, but revolutions/civil wars taking money, time, and people. TheShadowBrokers has is having little of each as our auction was an apparent failure. Be considering this our form of protest. The password for the EQGRP-Auction-Files is CrDj”(;Va.*NdlnzB9M?@K2)#>deB7mN

But we’d still be happy to accept donations to further the cause. 19BY2XCgbDe6WtTVbTyzM9eR3LYr6VitWK|||
