Verizon announced that its Fios fiber optic internet offerings are getting a serious upgrade today with Fios Gigabit Connection.

Despite the “gigabit” name, the new service offers slightly less than gigabit speeds at a still impressive 940 Mbps down / 880 Mbps up, and serves as an upgrade to Fios Instant Internet, which offered 750 Mbps upload and download speeds.

Along with the faster speeds, Verizon is also simplifying its service offerings for Fios internet in areas where the new speeds are available, in what seems to be an effort to strongly push the new plan. Those customers will have a choice between just two tiers for standalone internet: Fios Gigabit Connection for $69.99 a month, and a comically slower 50 Mbps option for $39.99 a month. Customers with Fios Instant Internet will also be automatically upgraded to the faster speed.

Verizon will also offer a bundled option with a two-year contract that nets you Fios Gigabit Connection with TV and phone, set to cost $79.99 a month for the first year and $84.99 a month for the second.

According to Verizon, the new (almost) gigabit internet will be available to customers in the New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Richmond, Va., Hampton Roads, Va., Boston, Providence and Washington, D.C. areas, but you’ll probably have to check with your local Fios service given the historically spotty availability of Fios.|||
