I’ve not written for a while, I failed with my habit because I didn’t actually build one. I’ve never had a day and time to write. I committed with myself, that I had to write at least once but I end up failing a lot of times.

I learn that for me, this kind of approach it’s not good enough to build a new habit because this allows me to fail without noticing.

In order to build a new habit, especially if it’s only once a week, I need to be strict to a specific day and time which I can’t fail. So if I end up failing I know right away and I can tinker my schedule or find a solution in order to not happen again.

So that’s what I’m about to do. I’m choosing a time and a day a week to write. It usually takes me about an hour, more or less, so I have to fit it in my day.

I think with this approach I will finally build this habit and be consistent with writing, something that I care.|||
