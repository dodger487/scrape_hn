Debian is shutting down its public FTP services

------------------------------------------------------------------------ The Debian Project https://www.debian.org/ Shutting down public FTP services press@debian.org April 25th, 2017 https://www.debian.org/News/2017/20170425 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ After many years of serving the needs of our users, and some more of declining usage in favor of better options, all public-facing debian.org FTP services will be shut down on November 1, 2017. These are: * ftp://ftp.debian.org * ftp://security.debian.org This decision is driven by the following considerations: * FTP servers have no support for caching or acceleration. * Most software implementations have stagnated and are awkward to use and configure. * Usage of the FTP servers is pretty low as our own installer has not offered FTP as a way to access mirrors for over ten years. * The protocol is inefficient and requires adding awkward kludges to firewalls and load-balancing daemons. Information for users --------------------- The DNS names ftp.debian.org and ftp.<CC>.debian.org will remain the same. The mirrors should just be accessed using HTTP instead: * http://ftp.debian.org * http://security.debian.org Information for developers -------------------------- Our developer services will not be affected. These are the upload queues for both the main and the security archive: * ftp://ftp.upload.debian.org * ftp://security-master.debian.org About Debian ------------ The Debian Project is an association of Free Software developers who volunteer their time and effort in order to produce the completely free operating system Debian. Contact Information ------------------- For further information, please visit the Debian web pages at https://www.debian.org/, send mail to <press@debian.org>, or contact the mirror team at their public mailing list <debian-mirrors@lists.debian.org>.
