Multiocular O (ꙮ) is a rare glyph variant of the Cyrillic letter O. This glyph variant can be found in certain manuscripts in the phrase «серафими многоꙮчитїи» ("many-eyed seraphim"). It was documented by Yefim Karsky[1] from a copy of Psalms[2] from around 1429, now found in the collection[3] of the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius, and subsequently incorporated[4] into Unicode as character U+A66E.|||
