Ever since I got to play with Jörg Hoppe's awesome KI10 front panel at the VCFB 2014 I wanted to do something with the PDP-10. To have something to show at the VCFB 2015 I wrote a simple assembler and started to write some basic console IO functions. I began to really like the instruction set and started porting my very primitive PDP-11 forth. Since this time I used an assembler it was much faster to modify the code and I got the basics working in time for the VCFB. The next few days after the VCFB I extended it a bit to make it presentable. I used jonesforth as a guide or inspiration for some things but the main code was written independently.

This is a very simple assembler. Its syntax is neither that of MACRO10 nor that of MIDAS. It reads from stdin and outputs , which can be loaded by simh with .

This forth is case sensitive, use upper case.

The PDP-10 is word and not byte addressed so I had to think of a way to store strings. Storing an ASCII character (7 bits) into 36 bits seemed wasteful so I used the PDP-10's byte instructions to pack 5 characters into one word. This makes handling strings a bit awkwards and currently all code handling them is implemented in assembly. I've not decided how to expose this in forth yet.

Only a subset of forth words are implemented as of now. Since the only input method is via terminal all definitions must be compiled by hand. The plan is to write a paper tape driver and to load forth code from there.

Defined words: EXIT INTERPRET QUIT ABORT CREATE : ; CONSTANT VARIABLE BRANCH 0BRANCH (LITERAL) , [ ] . .S DROP SWAP DUP ?DUP OVER ROT -ROT >R R> R@ RSP@ 1+ 1- + - * /MOD / MOD = <> < <= > >= 0= 0<> 0< 0<= 0> 0>= AND OR XOR NOT ABS NEGATE MIN MAX WORD ! +! @ HERE STATE BASE >IN IF THEN ELSE BEGIN AGAIN WHILE REPEAT DO UNLOOP LOOP +LOOP I J EMIT KEY CR SPACE

There is no real error handling. When a word isn't found in the dictionary it panics and goes into an endless loop.

I did not implement any standard although I used FORTH-79 for reference often.

Lastly I hope my assembly is at least somewhat idiomatic. I've been programming PDP-10 assembly for only 1-2 weeks now so my experience is limited and I have not read much other PDP-10 code yet. I'd like to hear your criticism.

Compile and assemble with . Start from simh and to load the paper tape into memory. Start execution with|||
