Add the Mono repository to your system The package repository hosts the packages you need, add it with the following commands. The package mono-devel should be installed to compile code. The package mono-complete should be installed to install everything - this should cover most cases of "assembly not found" errors. The package mono-dbg should be installed to get debugging symbols for framework libraries - allowing you to get line numbers in stack traces. The package referenceassemblies-pcl should be installed for PCL compilation support - this will resolve most cases of "Framework not installed: .NETPortable" errors during software compilation. The package ca-certificates-mono should be installed to get SSL certificates for HTTPS connections. Install this package if you run into trouble making HTTPS connections. The package mono-xsp4 should be installed for running ASP.NET applications. After the installation completed successfully, it's a good idea to run through the basic hello world examples on this page to verify Mono is working correctly. Mono on Linux before 3.12 by default didn't trust any SSL certificates so you got errors when accessing HTTPS resources. This is not required anymore as 3.12 and later include a new tool that runs on package installation and syncs Mono's certificate store with the system certificate store (on older versions you had to import Mozilla's list of trusted certificates by running ). Some systems are configured in a way so that the necessary package isn't pulled in when Mono is installed, in those cases make sure the package is installed.
