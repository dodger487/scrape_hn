While this may appear as a humdrum one line change, it's actually quite important. An sk_buff stores data in three places: 1. A linear chunk of allocated memory in skb->data. This is the easiest one to work with, but it precludes using scatterdata since the memory must be linear. 2. The array skb_shinfo(skb)->frags, which is of maximum length MAX_SKB_FRAGS. This is nice for scattergather, since these fragments can point to different pages. 3. skb_shinfo(skb)->frag_list, which is a pointer to another sk_buff, which in turn can have data in either (1) or (2). The first two are rather easy to deal with, since they're of a fixed maximum length, while the third one is not, since there can be potentially limitless chains of fragments. Fortunately dealing with frag_list is opt-in for drivers, so drivers don't actually have to deal with this mess. For whatever reason, macsec decided it wanted pain, and so it explicitly specified NETIF_F_FRAGLIST. Because dealing with (1), (2), and (3) is insane, most users of sk_buff doing any sort of crypto or paging operation calls a convenient function called skb_to_sgvec (which happens to be recursive if (3) is in use!). This takes a sk_buff as input, and writes into its output pointer an array of scattergather list items. Sometimes people like to declare a fixed size scattergather list on the stack; othertimes people like to allocate a fixed size scattergather list on the heap. However, if you're doing it in a fixed-size fashion, you really shouldn't be using NETIF_F_FRAGLIST too (unless you're also ensuring the sk_buff and its frag_list children arent't shared and then you check the number of fragments in total required.) Macsec specifically does this: size += sizeof(struct scatterlist) * (MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1); tmp = kmalloc(size, GFP_ATOMIC); *sg = (struct scatterlist *)(tmp + sg_offset); ... sg_init_table(sg, MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1); skb_to_sgvec(skb, sg, 0, skb->len); Specifying MAX_SKB_FRAGS + 1 is the right answer usually, but not if you're using NETIF_F_FRAGLIST, in which case the call to skb_to_sgvec will overflow the heap, and disaster ensues.
